            At Medplus, we strive to provide you with a seamless and
             enjoyable shopping experience. We want to take a moment to remind you
              of some key aspects when adding items to your cart. Please be aware
               that while items are in your cart, they are not reserved, and their
                availability is not guaranteed until you complete the checkout process.
                 Due to high demand or other factors, items may become unavailable or
                  their prices may fluctuate before you finalize your purchase.
                   We encourage you to review your cart carefully, ensuring that
                    quantities, sizes, and other details are accurate before proceeding
                     to checkout. It's also important to note that items in your cart
                      may have a limited time before they are automatically removed,
                       ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information. By proceeding
                        with your purchase, you acknowledge and accept these conditions.

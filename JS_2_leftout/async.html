        // this is to help understand how js works
        // by default js is synchronous ===== This means that js executes the code line by after each tast
        // is completed
        // so if a task will take about two minutes for it to finish exeuting 
        // the next task will by default wait after two minutes


        // Asynchronous js 
        // this means tasks that are asynchronous will move to web API and executes there 
        // allowing all the tasks to continue to execute and after all these tasks are executed
        // the asynchronous tasks will later be called back(callback) and join at the end

        // setTimeout is an example of asynchronous js
        // event object logics are also examples of asynchronous js




        console.log("1");
        console.log("2");

        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log("3");

        },1000);
        // here setTime will be outputted last 
        // this is not because of the time you've given to the setTimeOut
        // even is the time is 0 it will still output last

        console.log("4");

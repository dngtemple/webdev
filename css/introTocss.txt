INTRODUCTION TO CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)

CSS is used together with html elements to make them look good by;
-changing color
-changing size
=changing font
    and so on...


The format for writting css is
      property:value;


There are 3 main ways to apply css on an element

-inline
-internal
-external

         INLINE
This is done by typing in the tag
<elemet style="color:red; font-family:calibri"></element>
Note: With inline you can't use another tags style for another tag
      It must always be written




         INTERNAL
This is done by putting the <style></style> in the head tag
and using a selector

p{
    color:red;
}
This will make all <p> tag contents red

incase you want a specific one you must give it a name
by using a class or id

      class 
<p class="one">
to call this particular p
 
     .one{
        color:green;
     }
